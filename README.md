# piazza-booster

Simple Chrome Extension to make it easy to hide resolved follow ups on Piazza (because who needs to see those?), to hide +1s (they only make looking at actual posts harder), and/or to hide all replies on Piazza (for when you only need to see the actual follow ups). Made to combat the common problem of students +1ing lots of posts, of a thread going super long and making it difficult to find the unresolved follow ups. The extension also supports pagination.
